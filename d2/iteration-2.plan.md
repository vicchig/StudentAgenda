**Team Rules**


Communications:



*   Team Communications
    *   Discord - every day as necessary and weekly meetings on Fridays from   6 pm - 7 pm
*   Partner Communications
    *   Email as needed
    *   Skype meetings every other week on Wednesdays (12pm - 1pm)

Meetings:



*   Accountability for not Attending Meetings and Not Completing Action Items
    *   If work is not completed or a meeting is not attended, we will contact the person and discuss why they are not completing their responsibilities. The purpose of this meeting would be not to antagonize the person, but to find out how the group can help.
    *   After the above meeting, if work is not completed or meetings are not attended on a regular basis, we would employ a strike system. For each time an issue or ticket is not completed on time, we would find out the reason why and if the reason was not legitimate (exams, medical/family emergency, etc) we would apply a strike to that teammate.

    *   If a teammate receives three strikes, we would contact our TA or instructor to hopefully find a resolution.
    *   A person is able to erase a strike through a group meeting where they show the work they have done and how they made up for the uncompleted tickets. A person is also able to erase strikes by helping out other members.  


Conflict Resolution:



*   Team members being indecisive:
    *   Organize a meeting and have team members voice their opinions for either side to try and convince team members to decide either way
    *   If that doesnâ€™t succeed, bring topic at hand to a vote, we have a group of 7 people, so ties are impossible.
*   Team members not responding:
    *   Try to contact them via different mediums at first (maybe phone broke, etc.)
    *   If repeated attempts to contact fail, try and see them in person at school
    *   If this fails, seek advice of TA/Instructor
*   Team member being combative:
    *   Give them some time to calm down and think over their actions
    *   If the behaviour continues, immediately go to a TA as this behaviour will not be tolerated.

####
**Events**


We will be online using Discord to communicate with our team members. Communication will be done when necessary and we will also have weekly meetings on Friday from 6pm to 7pm. On the Friday meeting, we will conduct a code review and discuss what we have done. We will all comment on each other's work and discuss any problems we have if any. Next, we will discuss what we are planning to do in the following week and talk about any issues we might run into.

**Partner Meetings**


#####
**Meeting 1 (October 7)**



*   Video call meeting from 1pm to 2pm over _Zoom_

######
**Meeting Minutes:**

*   Users include students, parents and teachers with different features available to each user group
*   The app should offer enough functionality to be a replacement of the physical agenda
*   The app should minimally support a number of users equal to the size of an average middle school class
*   Partner would like students to be involved in the development process with possible field trips to UofT from 8:55 am to 11:40 am
    *   Ideally meet with the students once in the beginning, middle and end of the project development cycle
*   Application should be supported by a mobile platform
*   Teachers and parents should be able to monitor student progress over the app
*   No need to submit assignments over the app (Google Classroom is being used for this already)
*   Would be nice for students to be able to ask questions and collaborate over the platform (something similar to Piazza?)
*   Integrate Google Classroom features if possible

######
**Meeting Outcomes:**

*   Confirmed primary users being students, secondary users being teachers and parents
*   Confirmed scale as being just for a single class for now
*   Obtained new information to facilitate user story creation
*   Gained more understanding of what the product is expected to be; started thinking of what technologies would be best suited (Flask, FireBase, Flutter, languages)
*   Agreed on next meeting being Oct 9 at 1pm

#####
**Meeting 2 (October 9)**

*   Video call meeting from 1pm to 2pm over _Skype_

######
**Meeting Minutes (Discussion Points):**

*   Need students to enter marks into the app themselves (later clarified that this can be integrated with Google Classroom by just pulling marks off of there)
*   Motivate students to use the software just like an agenda
*   Need a goal setting feature letting students set incremental goals and to measure progress throughout the academic year
    *   If the results are below expectations, the application will help guide the students to success (provides task breakdown options based on priority which is calculated through a mix of assignment weight, due date and size)
    *   These goals can be more of a completion style goals and are added to the app by the students themselves
    *   Teachers should be able to view these goals
*   Simple chat function between students only
    *   Teachers should have moderation permissions such as deleting messages and flagging useful ones
*   Students should be able to upload pictures of notes onto Google Classroom and have them be automatically synced without app
*   Ability for students to add assignments themselves is needed
    *   Assignments to be divided according to type (individual, partner, group, etc...) and subject (math, English, French, science, etc...)
    *   Should offer subtasks to be added when an assignment is added
*   Ok with just Android for now
*   Bonus: Integrate Google Classroom
*   Bonus: Dictionary/Thesaurus function
*   Partner wants students to have a tour of the university and its facilities (If possible, need to organize with the Community Partnership Center and David). Tentative date is Oct. 30

######
**Meeting Outcomes:**

*   Now have a better idea of what the school is expecting
*   Confirmed Android as the minimal functional platform
*   Confirmed application features
*   Confirmed time of regular meetings being Wednesdays from 12pm to 1pm
*   Confirmed amount of student involvement desired by the school

####
**Artifacts**

*   Discord for communication, organization
*   Trello for task management and reminders
    *   Trello allows us to create a board to organize our work with scrum
    *   Tasks are organized by user stories
    *   We prioritize stories related to the Agenda and Performance aspects of the product
*   Git for version control

###
**Highlights**


####
**Questions For Partner: **


Completed:



*   ~~We can get data from google classroom to mark things on the agenda and add things such as marks. Is this a use case that works with the expected project and if so what type of data from google classroom would you like to be used?~~
*   ~~Where should we store data? Should we continue to use google products like you currently are?~~
*   ~~What are you currently using google classroom for (what are the students and teachers doing on google classroom currently)? What software are you currently using besides classroom?~~
*   ~~Monitoring of students? Would there be any type of monitoring in place so that teachers or other staff can view what students have posted, in case of inappropriate content? (especially in the chat)~~
*   ~~What is meant by the camera being accessible on google classroom and would like the ability to "pull" this info?~~
*   ~~More info on task chunking and the goal setting~~

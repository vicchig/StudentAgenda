# TDSB-Student Agenda (Team 1)

## Iteration 02
#### Start Date: 29/10/2019
#### End Date:    11/11/2019

## Process
Each team member will do one or several screens/functions of our app. We also converted our user stories into tasks that each member would do and split some large user stories into multiple tasks. These are uploaded to Trello and organized by sprints. As goals are completed they are marked as such on Trello and a pull request is made on GitHub.

## **Roles & responsibilities**
Each team member did one or several screens/functions of our app. We converted our user stories into tasks that each member did.

####
**Team Rules**

##### Communications:
*   Team Communications
    *   Discord - every day as necessary and weekly meetings on Fridays from   6 pm - 7 pm
    *   Partner Communications
        *   Email as needed
        *   Skype meetings every other week on Wednesdays (12pm - 1pm)
#### Meetings:
*   Accountability for not Attending Meetings and Not Completing Action Items
    *   If work is not completed or a meeting is not attended, we will contact the person and discuss why they are not completing their responsibilities. The purpose of this meeting would be not to antagonize the person, but to find out how the group can help.
    *   After the above meeting, if work is not completed or meetings are not attended on a regular basis, we would employ a strike system. For each time an issue or ticket is not completed on time, we would find out the reason why and if the reason was not legitimate (exams, medical/family emergency, etc) we would apply a strike to that teammate.
    *   If a teammate receives three strikes, we would contact our TA or instructor to hopefully find a resolution.
    *   A person is able to erase a strike through a group meeting where they show the work they have done and how they made up for the uncompleted tickets. A person is also able to erase strikes by helping out other members.  

#### Conflict Resolution:

*   Team members being indecisive:
    *   Organize a meeting and have team members voice their opinions for either side to try and convince team members to decide either way
    *   If that doesn’t succeed, bring topic at hand to a vote, we have a group of 7 people, so ties are impossible.
*   Team members not responding:
    *   Try to contact them via different mediums at first (maybe phone broke, etc.)
    *   If repeated attempts to contact fail, try and see them in person at school
    *   If this fails, seek advice of TA/Instructor
*   Team member being combative:
    *   Give them some time to calm down and think over their actions
    *   If the behaviour continues, immediately go to a TA as this behaviour will not be tolerated.

####
**Events**
We will be online using Discord to communicate with our team members. Communication will be done when necessary and we will also have weekly meetings on Friday from 6pm to 7pm. On the Friday meeting, we will conduct a code review and discuss what we have done. We will all comment on each other's work and discuss any problems we have if any. Next, we will discuss what we are planning to do in the following week and talk about any issues we might run into.

###
**Partner Meetings**
####
**Meeting 1 (October 7)**
*   Video call meeting from 1pm to 2pm over _Zoom_
######
**Meeting Minutes:**
*   Users include students, parents and teachers with different features available to each user group
*   The app should offer enough functionality to be a replacement of the physical agenda
*   The app should minimally support a number of users equal to the size of an average middle school class
*   Partner would like students to be involved in the development process with possible field trips to UofT from 8:55 am to 11:40 am
    *   Ideally meet with the students once in the beginning, middle and end of the project development cycle
*   Application should be supported by a mobile platform
*   Teachers and parents should be able to monitor student progress over the app
*   No need to submit assignments over the app (Google Classroom is being used for this already)
*   Would be nice for students to be able to ask questions and collaborate over the platform (something similar to Piazza?)
*   Integrate Google Classroom features if possible

######
**Meeting Outcomes:**

*   Confirmed primary users being students, secondary users being teachers and parents
*   Confirmed scale as being just for a single class for now
*   Obtained new information to facilitate user story creation
*   Gained more understanding of what the product is expected to be; started thinking of what technologies would be best suited (Flask, FireBase, Flutter, languages)
*   Agreed on next meeting being Oct 9 at 1pm


####
**Meeting 2 (October 9)**
*   Video call meeting from 1pm to 2pm over _Skype_

######
**Meeting Minutes (Discussion Points):**

*   Need students to enter marks into the app themselves (later clarified that this can be integrated with Google Classroom by just pulling marks off of there)
*   Motivate students to use the software just like an agenda
*   Need a goal setting feature letting students set incremental goals and to measure progress throughout the academic year
    *   If the results are below expectations, the application will help guide the students to success (provides task breakdown options based on priority which is calculated through a mix of assignment weight, due date and size)
    *   These goals can be more of a completion style goals and are added to the app by the students themselves
    *   Teachers should be able to view these goals
*   Simple chat function between students only
    *   Teachers should have moderation permissions such as deleting messages and flagging useful ones
*   Students should be able to upload pictures of notes onto Google Classroom and have them be automatically synced without app
*   Ability for students to add assignments themselves is needed
    *   Assignments to be divided according to type (individual, partner, group, etc...) and subject (math, English, French, science, etc...)
    *   Should offer subtasks to be added when an assignment is added
*   Ok with just Android for now
*   Bonus: Integrate Google Classroom
*   Bonus: Dictionary/Thesaurus function
*   Partner wants students to have a tour of the university and its facilities (If possible, need to organize with the Community Partnership Center and David). Tentative date is Oct. 30

######
**Meeting Outcomes:**
*   Now have a better idea of what the school is expecting
*   Confirmed Android as the minimal functional platform
*   Confirmed application features
*   Confirmed time of regular meetings being Wednesdays from 12pm to 1pm
*   Confirmed amount of student involvement desired by the school

####
**Meeting 3 (Nov1)**
Video call over Skype
######
**Meeting Minutes (Discussion Points):**
* "Could you walk through how the teachers would make the goals/subtasks, is it per assignment or just goals in general?"
* Track their own general goals such as “I want to have an average of 95%” (outside of assignment goals) (these are outside of the general course or assignment goals)
* Also students choose their own goals for each assignment (they make them themselves)
* “How are marks posted for assignments?”
* Students themselves have the option of submitting marks for each assignment onto the app, there is not need to pull them
__Nov 18 and nov 22 noon meeting with tech person.__
######
**Meeting Outcomes:**
* Understood project requirements better 
* Fire alarm went off 7 minutes into the call, so we only got a chance to ask a couple of our  most pressing questions.

####
**Artifacts**
*   Trello for task management:   
*   Trello allows us to create a board to organize our work with scrum
*   Used to assign and distribute tasks among team members. Also outlined sprint deadlines.
*   We prioritize tasks related to the Agenda and Performance aspects of the product  
*   Git for version control

####
**Github Workflow**
We have three main branches in our Github repository. The first is master: this is used for finished features of the app and submissions for deliverables. The second is Development: this branch is used for ongoing changes that are in development. The third is Fixes: this branch is used for hotfixes or other small changes that need to be pushed to development or master immediately. 

Besides these branches, each member of the group will create a feature branch for their respective work on the application. They are able to work freely on this branch and pull changes made by other members on development. After the feature is completed, the member will then create a pull request for merging their feature branch to master. Once the pull request is created, at least two members of the group need to review it and approve the changes before it is merged into Development. However, there must be a group consensus on the changes. For example, if two people approve the pull request but a third requests changes to it, these changes must be addressed before the branch is merged. This process is the same for merging Development into Master. 

We chose this process because it minimizes the amount of merge conflicts we have by separating the branches people are working on. Secondly, it allows us to have a group consensus on any changes made, and also minimizes the number of simple errors that are pushed since multiple people have to review the changes. Also, it ensures that the master branch is kept clean and only contains working code since we push to development rather than master.

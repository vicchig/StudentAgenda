# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

> _Note:_ This document is intended to be relatively short. Be concise and precise. Assume the reader has no prior knowledge of your application and is non-technical. 

## Description 
 * Provide a high-level description of your application and it's value from an end-user's perspective
 * What is the problem you're trying to solve?
 * Is there any context required to understand **why** the application solves this problem?
Many middle school students have trouble keeping up with tasks they write down in their agendas; many don't even write anything down. Our application aims to help solve and simplify these organizational by automating some of the processes involved. Instead of constantly checking online for when an assignment has been assigned, students will get notifications from our application, which links to their Google Classroom accounts, every time an assignment has been posted. Students can then set up in-app goals and reminders for the work that has to be done for the assignment and track their overall progress through our performance metrics.


## Key Features
 * Described the key features in the application that the user can access
 * Feel free to provide a breakdown or detail for each feature that is most appropriate for your application <br/>
__1. Log in through Google:__<br/>
Users are able to link their Google Classroom accounts to our application by signing in through their Gmail account.
Our application then pulls the following information from their Google Classroom classes and either displays it in our application or uses it internally:
    * Class lists
    * Course works
    * Course announcements
    * Course teachers
    * Course topics
<br/>
__2. Users are able to make course specific goals:__<br/>
Users are able to select goals from a predefined list of goals selected by the teacher and uploaded to the application. The user is able to choose the date the goal is due, change the description of the goal and mark goals as completed. After being added, the goal is stored in a database and the application keeps track of it for the user.

__3. Goal Notifications:__ <br/>

<br/>

__4. Perfmormance Metrics:__ <br/>
Our application offers a variety of metrics to track a user's performance. It provides information about completed, created, late and incomplete goals for the past four, five and 12 months. The user is able to view dynamic pie charts displaying the ratio of each type of goal for that time period, a timeline of completed goals and the counts of each type of goal in a colour-coded table in the Performance screen.
<br/>

__5. Calendar View:__ <br/>
<br/>

## Instructions
 * Clear instructions for how to use the application from the end-user's perspective
 * How do you access it? Are accounts pre-created or does a user register? Where do you start? etc. 
 * Provide clear steps for using each feature described above
 * If you cannot deploy your application for technical reasons, please let your TA know at the beginning of the iteration. You will need to demo the application to your partner either way.
 
 ## Development requirements
 * If a developer were to set this up on their machine or a remote server, what are the technical requirements (e.g. OS, libraries, etc.)?
 * Briefly describe instructions for setting up and running the application (think a true README).


 ## Licenses 
We are going to be using an MIT license. This allows anyone (most importantly our partner) to freely modify our codebase as they see fit. This will allow our partner to make any additions or changes to our application as they see fit. In addition, it removes any responsibility from us in regards to further supporting the software or any damages that may have occurred in connection with our product. We want this mostly because we are unlikely to be actively supporting this product in the future.

# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

> _Note:_ This document is intended to be relatively short. Be concise and precise. Assume the reader has no prior knowledge of your application and is non-technical. 

## Description 
 * Provide a high-level description of your application and it's value from an end-user's perspective
 * What is the problem you're trying to solve?
 * Is there any context required to understand **why** the application solves this problem?
Many middle school students have trouble keeping up with tasks they write down in their agendas; many don't even write anything down. Our application aims to help solve and simplify these organizational by automating some of the processes involved. Instead of constantly checking online for when an assignment has been assigned, students will get notifications from our application, which links to their Google Classroom accounts, every time an assignment has been posted. Students can then set up in-app goals and reminders for the work that has to be done for the assignment and track their overall progress through our performance metrics.


## Key Features
 * Described the key features in the application that the user can access
 * Feel free to provide a breakdown or detail for each feature that is most appropriate for your application

## Instructions
 * Clear instructions for how to use the application from the end-user's perspective
 * How do you access it? Are accounts pre-created or does a user register? Where do you start? etc. 
 * Provide clear steps for using each feature described above
 * If you cannot deploy your application for technical reasons, please let your TA know at the beginning of the iteration. You will need to demo the application to your partner either way.
 
 ## Development requirements
 * If a developer were to set this up on their machine or a remote server, what are the technical requirements (e.g. OS, libraries, etc.)?
 * Briefly describe instructions for setting up and running the application (think a true README).


 ## Licenses 

 Keep this section as brief as possible. You may read this [Github article](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository) for a start.

 * What type of license will you apply to your codebase?
 * What affect does it have on the development and use of your codebase?
 * Why did you or your partner make this choice?

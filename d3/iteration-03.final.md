# Student Agenda

## Iteration 03

 * Start date: 14/11/2019
 * End date:   01/12/2019

### Changes from you `product.md`

__1. Scope Reduction:__<br/>
In order to meet our deadlines we had to remove the following features from the project:
* Reduce platform scope from Desktop and Mobile (iOS and Android) to just Mobile (Android).
* Chat function
* Camera integration (For Chat)
* Ability to get notifications for marks posted on Google Classroom. We discovered that this is already done by default on Google Classroom and so we do not have to redo it in our app.
* File sharing ability (For Chat)
* Parent monitoring of student account

Removing these has allowed us to spend significantly more time on the critical features that our product had to have and make sure that those are complete by the deadline.<br/>

<br/>

__3. Stack Changes:__<br/>
At first we thought that the backend would have to be written in Java as Dart is primarily a front-end language. However, we have since then learned that Dart can be used for backend programming as well and decided to use that for our backend. This change simplified our development process as we could have all of our code in one place and in one language instead of people having to focus on writing code in two separate languages at the same time.<br/>



### Handoff plan
We are going to offer as much flexibility as possible to our partner by providing multiple hand off platforms. We will host the project on Google Drive and GitHub. The [Google Drive will contain a compiled APK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jB17rdsIsMsg4Ml-wohERdrAKem1_m_T/view?usp=sharing) as a demonstration of the minimal viable product. The GitHub repo will contain the codebase that can be cloned or forked as the partner sees fit.

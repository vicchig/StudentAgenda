## Product Details

### Q1: What are you planning to build?
An organizational platform in the form of a mobile application that helps middle school students organize their work and build organizational skills by allowing them to track their class assignments and marks, and collaborate through a chat function. Currently students have paper agendas that they are not using, our application aims to offer a more flexible alternative to it in the form of a digital agenda that students can easily use on their personal electronic devices.  

For a physical agenda to work it has to be constantly updated manually by the student. A student who is struggling to do so on a consistent basis could use our product instead since it will updated automatically and could alert them when an assignment has been posted by the teacher as well as sending notifications close to the due date of the assignment. For students who are better organized, the platform would offer a way of keeping an easier track of all of their assignments without the hassle of going through pages upon pages in agenda searching for due dates.  

Teachers would use the platform to post marks for each assignment and parents would be able to track their child's progress for every class that is available on the platform.

### Q2: Who are your target users?
Our primary users will be Grade 6 - 8 students who are taking a number of different classes such as (English, French, Mathematics and Science) and are having difficulty in keeping track of all of their assigned work between classes. Secondary users will include teachers of said students who will use the platform to post assignments and grades, as well as parents who will use the platform to track their child's progress.  

### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?
Students would use our application to organize the information for all of their classes on one platform. Currently students are using a combination of Google Classroom and paper agendas in order to organize their class work. This creates the problem of updating Google classroom to be consistent with the agenda and vice versa. Ideally, the students will only have to check and work with a single platform instead of keeping track of information on multiple platforms. Our application will help students organize their work by keeping all of the information about assignments and classes in a single place (platform), allow students to track assignments by receiving notifications of when assignments are  posted and receive continuous notifications before an assignment is due (currently Google classroom offers a notification feature for when something is posted, but we would like to continuously remind students that they should be working on a project) and allow students to set their own incremental deadlines for a project and receive notifications for those deadlines to help them keep track of their progress and lastly provide calendar timelines for their assignments. In addition, we will provide a chat function that saves students time on assignments by allowing them to collaborate; Google classroom currently only supports comments. The aim is to not replace Google classroom, but to integrate additional features of our application with Google classroom so that in combination they may replace the need for a paper agenda.  

Teachers would use the platform to ensure that when they post assignments and marks, students are immediately notified. Parents would be saved time in keeping track of their child's progress since all of the information about it would be available on one platform, allowing for quick and easy access.

#### Questions: (To be asked on Wednesday)
* We can get data from google classroom to mark things on the agenda and add things such as marks. Is this a use case that works with the expected project and if so what type of data from google classroom would you like to be used?
* Where should we store data? Should we continue to use google products like you currently are?
* What are you currently using google classroom for (what are the students and teachers doing on google classroom currently)? What software are you currently using besides classroom?

#### Questions: (To be asked on Wednesday)
We can get data from google classroom to mark things on the agenda and add things such as marks. Is this a use case that works with the expected project and if so what type of data from google classroom would you like to be used?
Where should we store data? Should we continue to use google products like you currently are?
What are you currently using google classroom for (what are the students and teachers doing on google classroom currently)? What software are you currently using besides classroom?

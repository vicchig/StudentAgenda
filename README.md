## Product Details

### Q1: What are you planning to build?
An organizational platform in the form of a mobile application that helps middle school students organize their work and build organizational skills by allowing them to track their class assignments and marks, and collaborate through a chat function. Currently students have paper agendas that they are not using, our application aims to offer a more flexible alternative to it in the form of a digital agenda that students can easily use on their personal electronic devices. 

For a physical agenda to work it has to be constantly updated manually by the student. A student who is struggling to do so on a consistent basis could use our product instead since it will updated automatically and could alert them when an assignment has been posted by the teacher as well as sending notifications close to the due date of the assignment. For students who are better organized, the platform would offer a way of keeping an easier track of all of their assignments without the hastle of going through pages upon pages in agenda searching for due dates.

Teachers would use the platform to post marks for each assignment and parents would be able to track their child's progress for every class that is available on the platform.

#### Questions: (To be asked on Wednesday)
We can get data from google classroom to mark things on the agenda and add things such as marks. Is this a use case that works with the expected project and if so what type of data from google classroom would you like to be used?
Where should we store data? Should we continue to use google products like you currently are?
What are you currently using google classroom for (what are the students and teachers doing on google classroom currently)? What software are you currently using besides classroom?
